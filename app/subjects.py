FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use "**Step 1:**", "**Step 2:**" etc. for each step
2. Write mathematical expressions in plain text: use x^2 for x¬≤, sqrt(x) for square roots
3. For fractions, use format: (numerator)/(denominator) - this will be displayed properly
4. Put each mathematical equation on its own line
5. Explain the reasoning behind each step
6. End with "**Final Answer:**" 
7. Keep explanations clear and concise
8. Add blank lines between steps for better readability

FRACTION EXAMPLES:
- Write dy/dx = (2x + 1)/(x^2 + 1) 
- Write y = (x^2 + 3x + 2)/(x + 1)
- This will display with numerator over denominator in a single box

Provide detailed explanations but keep the formatting clean and readable.""",

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):
1. Use "**Step 1:**", "**Step 2:**" etc. for each step (short title on one line)
2. On the next line, briefly explain the idea (why we do this step)
3. On the next line, put the equation with quantities and units in simple text (no LaTeX, no \\\(...\\\) or symbols). Examples:
   - v = u + a*t
   - F = m*a
   - v = sqrt(2*g*h)
4. Substitute numbers on a separate line, with SI units:
   - v = sqrt(2*9.8 m/s^2*10 m)
5. Compute and show the numeric result on its own line with the unit:
   - v = 14.0 m/s
6. Include a short "Assumptions" line when needed (e.g., ignore air resistance).
7. End with "**Final Answer:**" on its own line with the value and the unit.

STYLE:
- Plain text only (no LaTeX, no Greek letters, write "mu" not Œº)
- Keep numbers with 2‚Äì3 significant figures unless the question demands otherwise
- Always show units in every formula line and result line
- Add blank lines between steps for readability
